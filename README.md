            <p class="light">GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip — It started not with a bullet or a bomb, but with a hashtag.

"What if 200,000 demonstrators came out in a peaceful march and broke into the barbed wire east of Gaza," wrote Ahmed Abu Artema in a Facebook post on Jan. 7.

"What can a heavily-armed occupation do to those peaceful human waves?" the 32-year-old Palestinian journalist asked.

Artema ended the post with #GreatMarchofReturn — a slogan that quickly went viral and then, two months later, blossomed into reality.

On Monday and Tuesday, Artema's audacious "Great March of Return" will face what could be its most formidable and perhaps final test: an attempt by hundreds of thousands of protesters to breach the razor wire fence between the Gaza Strip and Israel.

            <p class="light">The Supreme Court has struck down a federal law that bars gambling on football, basketball, baseball and other sports in most states today. The decision gives states the go-ahead to legalize betting on sports.

The Supreme Court on Monday struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act. The 1992 law barred state-authorized sports gambling with some exceptions. It made Nevada the only state where a person could wager on the results of a single game.

CBS News' Jan Crawford reports that the the justices agreed 7-2 that the federal ban was unconstitutional, and that states have the authority to decide whether to offer legal sports betting. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonya Sotomayor dissented.</p>

            <p class="light">David Hess Jr. stood with about 20 people early Saturday morning under a large tent, which was protecting big bags of rice, donated clothes and canned food.

Except for the light drizzle tapping on the plastic tarps overhead, it was quiet. No one spoke. All eyes were fixed on Ikaika Marzo — a tall man with a thick, dark head of hair that made him appear even taller.

“Today is not going to be a normal day,” said Marzo, who was leading the group of volunteers. “There’s a new fissure. If gas comes over Highway 132, we’re going to have to move out of here quickly. For now, we’ll stay as long as we can.”</p>
